Navier-Stokes equations
=======================

    The **Navier–Stokes equations** (/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/ nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which
    describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier
    and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes. They were developed over several decades
    of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842-1850 (Stokes).
