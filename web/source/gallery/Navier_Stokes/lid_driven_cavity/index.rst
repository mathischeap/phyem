Lid-driven cavity
=================

The lid-driven cavity flow is a incompressible viscous flow.

In 2-dimensions, it is usually cast as follows. The domain is set to be
:math:`\Omega=[0,1]^2` with four infinite no-slip solid walls. The media
is still initially. From time :math:`t=0`,
the top wall, i.e. :math:`y=1`, moves left with a constant speed, i.e. the lid speed,
:math:`\left.\boldsymbol{u}\right|_{\mathrm{lid}}=\begin{bmatrix}-1, 0\end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T}`,
and drives the viscous flow.

.. Benchmark of this flow can be found in `[Benchmark, O. Botella, R. Peyret, Computers & Fluids] <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-7930(98)00002-4>`_.
