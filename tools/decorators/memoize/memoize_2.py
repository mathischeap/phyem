class memoize2(object):
    """ Cache the return value of a method in class.

    This class is meant to be used as a decorator of methods. The return value from
    a given method invocation will be cached on the instance whose method was
    invoked. All arguments passed to a method decorated with memoize must be
    hashable.

    If a memoized method is invoked directly on its class the result will not be
    cached. Instead of the method will be invoked like a static method:
    ::

       class Obj(object):
           @memoize2
           def add_to(self, arg):
               return self + arg

    ``Obj.add_to(1)`` # not enough arguments; ``Obj.add_to(1, 2)`` # returns 3, result is not cached

    - ``-``: Can not be used for frozen object. To use it for frozen object, use the method once before
        freeze the object.
    - ``-``: Can not be used for numpy.ndarray inputs.
    - ``+``: faster than memoize1.

    - ``-``: can not be dumped when used together with @accepts for one method.
