Runner Data. Here we wrap the `_rdf_` (Result DataFrame) into a seperate class in case
that in the future we what to future extend it.

We normalize it with the Parent `DFW` from `accessories.deta_structures`.

    In the future, maybe from multiple places, we will wrap a pandas DataFrame data

    This is a very special one, itself has no meaning, but in particular class, we can

    Because of this, it does not take its component visualization as an attribute here.
